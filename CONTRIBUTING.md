# Contributing to the RGSoC Teams App

* Introduction, thanks for contributing
* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Reporting a bug

* Very valuable
* Check if issue already exists

## Suggesting a new feature

### Labels

* Dibs
* Ping via comment and/or join Slack

## Creating a Pull Request
(inspired by [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))


* If related to an issue: better ask first
* Fork repo
* Install locally (see [README](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/master/README.md) for hints)
* Make sure tests pass locally: `rake spec`

### Create a Topic Branch

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Write Code

* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
* With tests (TODO: can be hard for beginners)
* Commits w/ descript

### Make a Pull Request

* Point to GH docs?

### Be Patient


## No idea where to put this:

* Purely code-cosmetic contributions are likely to not be accepted
