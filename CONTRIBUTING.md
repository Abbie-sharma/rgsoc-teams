## Reporting a bug

* Check if issue already exists
* Provide as many details as possible (screenshot)

## Suggesting a new feature

### Labels

* Dibs

## Resolving an existing issue

### Finding an issue

* See [`beginner-friendly`](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner-friendly) issues for your first steps in open source
* See [`#pairwithme`](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/labels/%23pairwithme) for more involving issues
* Make sure no one else is already working on it (assignee, comments)
* Check if issue is still valid (comments)

## Creating a Pull Request
(inspired by [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))


* If related to an issue: better ask first
* Fork repo
* Install locally (see [README](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/master/README.md) for hints)
* Make sure tests pass locally: `rake spec`

### Create a Topic Branch

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Write Code

* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
* Write tests for all your code.  
  A well defined test suite is as much part of the app as the tested code itself. It helps to ascertain the well-being of any software product - the Teams App being no exception here. But this should not be a blocker. See the existing tests to find out where yours would fit in and in case it's hard to get started, ask us, we'll help.
* Commits w/ descriptive commit message

### Make a Pull Request

* Point to GH docs?

### Be Patient


## No idea where to put this:

* Purely code-cosmetic contributions are likely to not be accepted
